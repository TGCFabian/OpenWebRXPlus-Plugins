# OpenWebRX-Plugins

Small collection of plugins and helpers for OpenWebRX+.
These are not written professionally, and most likely thrown together by GPT.

## Overview

This repository contains plugins, example integrations, and utilities intended to extend or integrate with OpenWebRX. It is organized to be lightweight and easy to adapt into existing OpenWebRX deployments.

## Preview

MultiSDR Selector
This isn't a pretty plugin — it may bug out if you have an RTL-SDR that suddenly drops out (requiring a refresh), but it works!

I made this plugin because I have 4 SDRs in one OpenWebRX+ instance, on different antennas, all with the same profiles.

## Support

## Note on some features in here
I personally thought certain features, such as a MultiSDR switch (for multi-antenna boxes without an antenna switcher), would be a neat idea, though sadly, this will not be added to the mainstream OpenWebRX.
